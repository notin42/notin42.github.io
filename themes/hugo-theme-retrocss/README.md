# 🖥️ RetroCSS 9x

**A Win9x-style Hugo theme for blogs and documentation** — mid-90s desktop chrome, WCAG AA in light *and* dark, keyboard-operable components, RTL, client-side search, and no build step beyond Hugo itself.

## Why this theme

It is [RetroCSS](https://github.com/PhantomPixelDev/RetroCSS) — a UI framework that reproduces the Windows 95/98 desktop look, with a real accessibility budget — wired into Hugo. The theme adds about eighty lines of layout CSS and nothing else: no second palette, no bespoke colours, no per-page overrides. Every surface you see is a framework component.

- **Authentic 90s desktop chrome.** Raised and sunken bevels, square corners, a grey chassis, and a light source fixed at the top-left. Code blocks get a real title bar.
- **Dark mode that follows the OS, with no flash.** The dark palette ships under `prefers-color-scheme` as well as `[data-theme]`, so a dark-OS visitor is painted dark on the first frame — even with the bundle blocked. CI fails the build on a theme flash.
- **WCAG AA in both themes, enforced.** Every rendered text node on every page is measured against the surface actually painted behind it, at five widths, in both themes.
- **Keyboard-operable.** Skip link, roving tabindex on tab strips and rating groups, tooltips on focus, named controls. Also a gate, not a claim.
- **No Sass, no Node, no CDN.** The framework's compiled CSS and JS are vendored and served through Hugo Pipes, fingerprinted with Subresource Integrity. The **standard** Hugo binary is enough — you do not need the extended build, and the site works offline and under a strict CSP.
- **Blog and docs in one theme.** Post grids, taxonomies, pagination, RSS; plus a weighted docs tree, breadcrumbs and in-page contents.
- **Search with no library.** The index is a page resource built at compile time; the whole search runs in the browser.
- **Right-to-left.** One config line mirrors the layout. The bevels deliberately do not mirror — the desktops they imitate did not mirror them either.

## Screens

Every shot below is the demo site in this repository, captured from the built output by `node scripts/screenshots.mjs` — so they cannot drift from what the theme actually renders.

## Requirements

Hugo **0.158.0 or newer**. The standard build is fine; extended is not required.

## Installation

### Hugo Modules (recommended)

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/you/your-site
```

```toml
# hugo.toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/PhantomPixelDev/hugo-theme-retrocss"
```

```bash
hugo mod get -u
```

### Git submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/PhantomPixelDev/hugo-theme-retrocss themes/hugo-theme-retrocss
```

```toml
theme = "hugo-theme-retrocss"
```

### Download

Copy the repository into `themes/hugo-theme-retrocss/` and set `theme` as above.

## Site configuration

Hugo does not merge a theme's `markup` config into the site's, so two settings have to live in **your** config. Everything else has a working default.

```toml
baseURL = "https://example.com/"
title = "Retro Dispatch"
theme = "hugo-theme-retrocss"

# Shortcodes and render hooks emit real markup.
[markup.goldmark.renderer]
  unsafe = true

# Keep tags reading the way they were written.
capitalizeListTitles = false

[pagination]
  pagerSize = 6

[params]
  description = "Notes on building interfaces that look like 1995 and behave like today."
  tagline = "a Win9x-style Hugo theme"     # appended to the home page's <title>

  # --- chrome ---
  accentHue = "primary"   # any RetroCSS hue: teal, violet, gold, navy, …
  borderRadius = "0"      # one token rounds the entire framework
  fontHeading = ""        # e.g. "'Segoe UI', Tahoma, sans-serif"
  sidebar = "left"        # left | right | off

  # --- content ---
  dateFormat = "2 January 2006"
  showReadingTime = true
  showAuthor = true
  showToc = true
  relatedPosts = 3
  mainSections = ["posts"]
  docsSection = "docs"

  # --- features ---
  search = true
  themeCredit = true      # "Built with Hugo and RetroCSS for Hugo" in the footer

  # --- SEO ---
  images = ["images/og-card.png"]
  twitterSite = "@you"

  [params.author]
    name = "Rita Delgado"
    initials = "RD"
    bio = "Writes about interface archaeology."

  [params.comments]
    provider = "none"     # none | giscus | utterances
```

Full reference: **[the theme's own docs](https://phantompixeldev.github.io/hugo-theme-retrocss/docs/)**, which are themselves a docs section built with the theme.

### Docs section

Docs layouts are chosen by page type, so set it once on the section and let it
cascade:

```yaml
---
title: "Documentation"
type: "docs"
cascade:
  type: "docs"
---
```

Order pages with `weight`; the sidebar tree, breadcrumbs and prev/next all read
it. A section not named `docs` also needs `params.docsSection`.

### Search page

```markdown
---
title: "Search"
layout: "search"
---
```

### Custom CSS

Drop a file at `assets/css/custom.css` in your site. The theme concatenates it last, so it wins without `!important`:

```css
:root { --retro-body-bg: #008080; }
```

## Shortcodes

One per interactive component, each a thin wrapper over markup the framework already styles.

| Shortcode | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `alert` | `type`, optional `title` |
| `card` | `header`, `footer`, `image`, `imageAlt` |
| `badge`, `button` | `type`, and `size`/`href` on `button` |
| `tabs` + `tab` | `title` per tab |
| `accordion` + `accordion-item` | `title` per item |
| `modal` | `id`, `title`, `trigger`, `footer` |
| `toast` | `message`, `type`, `duration` |
| `progress` | `value`, `label`, `type`, `striped` |
| `rating` | `value`, `max`, `label` — an ARIA radiogroup |
| `carousel` + `slide` | keyboard-driven dots |
| `table` | `striped`, `bordered`, `sortable`; wraps for small screens |
| `avatar` | `initials`, `size`, `hue` |
| `tooltip` | `text` — appears on focus, not only hover |

```markdown
{{</* alert type="warning" title="Careful" */>}}
Corners are square on purpose.
{{</* /alert */>}}
```

## What the theme renders

| Template | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `home.html` | featured post, post grid, pagination |
| `section.html` | any content section |
| `page.html` | article, byline, tags, prev/next, related, comments |
| `taxonomy.html` / `term.html` | tag and category listings |
| `docs/section.html`, `docs/page.html` | docs tree, breadcrumbs, in-page contents |
| `search.html` | client-side search over a build-time index |
| `404.html` | with links out |

Render hooks style images as figures, mark external links, add heading anchors, and give every code block the framework's title bar plus a copy button.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run serve      # http://localhost:1313
```

```bash
npm run check      # build the demo site, then both gates
```

`check:pages` renders every page of the demo site in Chromium, in both themes, at 1200/980/760/420/360px, and fails on a console error, horizontal overflow, a missing or duplicated `<h1>`, any rendered text below AA against the surface actually painted behind it, or a theme flash on first paint. `check:keyboard` asserts every control the framework drives is reachable and named, that roving-tabindex groups expose exactly one tab stop, that tooltips appear on focus, and that the skip link lands somewhere.

Both need a browser once: `npx playwright install chromium`.

### Updating RetroCSS

```bash
npm run vendor          # from a sibling RetroCSS checkout
npm run vendor:npm      # from the published package
```

The script refuses to vendor a `dist/` older than its `src/`, strips the sourcemap comment Hugo's fingerprinting would break, and rewrites `data/retrocss.toml` with the version and hashes. CI re-runs it and fails if the committed bundle has drifted.
