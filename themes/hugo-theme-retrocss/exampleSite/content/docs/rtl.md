The theme emits `dir` on `<html>`, and RetroCSS positions everything with
logical properties, so spacing, alignment and start/end positioning mirror with
nothing to import.

## What does not mirror

The bevels. In the Win9x visual language the light source is fixed at the
top-left, and Windows keeps it there in RTL; flipping the raised and sunken
edges would make every button read as sunken on the wrong side. Only the
semantic accents move — an alert's stripe, a blockquote's rule — because those
mark where a line of text begins.
