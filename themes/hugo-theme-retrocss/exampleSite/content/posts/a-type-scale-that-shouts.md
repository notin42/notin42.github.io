Windows 95 shipped at 96 DPI with an 8pt UI font. Reproducing that number today
produces text nobody can read on a phone, which is the difference between an
homage and a re-enactment.

## Steps, not sizes

`--retro-font-size-xs` through `-3xl`, all in `rem`, all derived from one body
size. A component asks for a step, never a pixel value, so a site that raises
the base size moves everything with it.

## Where the costume stops

The chrome is authentic: square corners, bevels lit from the top-left, a grey
chassis. The reading experience is not negotiable — 16px body text, a line
height near 1.5, and a measure that stops around 72 characters.
